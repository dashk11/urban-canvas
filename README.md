`npm install firebase && npm install firebase-tools -g`

## Inspiration
Our main inspiration to create this project was to democratise urban planning works in a city. This way, we can create awareness among the public about the structures which are being developed in the cities/surroundings. In turn, they will be able to take part in the decision making process.

## Project Structure
- Install firebase SDK using npm to deploy and test locally

Command to test locally: 
firebase emulators:start 

Command to deploy to firebase: firebase deploy --only hosting:eco-impact
